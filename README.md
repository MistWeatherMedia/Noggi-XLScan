# Inital Setup

### REQUIRES:

 - An IntelliStar 2 Jr
 - Data Encoder for the I2Jr (Noggi-XLScan works best wth MistWX-I2ME, but you can try other data encoders. Some might not work as well however.)
 - Constant stream of data (This can be accomplished with I2ME and most data encoders out there.)

**1.** Once the .zip has been extracted, place the TWC and vizrt files in C:\Program Files\. **THIS WILL NOT OVERWRITE EXISTING FILES.**

**2.** In Internet Explorer go to localhost:9091; or whatever port you set the web panel to, and look for "**Load and Run Playlist**", and input the values shown in the **Flavors** section of this README.

**You're all set! Open VLC, or any video playback software of your choice and open the network stream. You should see Noggi-XLScan running.**
